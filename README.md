# Drone-API
Catkin workspace for Drone API

As part of Eyantra competition ,this project includes designing a python script which takes raw accelerometer,gyroscope,
overhead camera data as input and gives motion commands to the drone. Objective here was to keep drone stable (even if 
disturbed by wind or shifted from the position intentionally) and land on a constantly moving target. Tracking of targets
is done using whycon marker (A Vision-based external localization system).
