# Drone-API
Catkin workspace for Drone API

As part of Eyantra competition, this project includes designing a python script which takes raw data such as accelerometer, gyroscope, overhead camera.. as input and gives motion commands to the drone. Objective here is to keep drone at a static position (even if disturbed by wind or intentionally moved) and land on a constantly moving target. Tracking of targets
is done using whycon marker (A Vision-based external localization system).
